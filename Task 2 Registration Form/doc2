Container Styling:

The container has a semi-transparent white background to enhance readability.
Rounded corners and a subtle box shadow give a modern and polished look.
Form Layout:

Used a grid layout for the form container for a cleaner and responsive design.
Aligned form items at the center using flexbox to maintain symmetry.
Input Styling:

Increased the width of input fields laterally for better usability.
Applied consistent padding, border, and border-radius for a cohesive look.
Ensured a balanced visual hierarchy with proper spacing between elements.
Button Styling:

Designed a visually appealing button with a green color scheme to attract attention.
Added a subtle hover effect for a more interactive feel.

Selected "Arial" as the font for its readability and simplicity.
Used a dark gray (#333) for the heading and a lighter gray (#555) for labels to maintain readability.
